    <h1>Christian Cross</h1>
    <img src="images/cross.png" alt="Christian Cross" />
    <p>The Christian cross, seen as a representation of the crucifixion of Jesus
       on a large wooden cross, is a renowned symbol of Christianity. It is
       related to the crucifix (a cross that includes a corpus, usually a
       three-dimensional with representation of Jesus' body) and to the more
       general family of cross symbols, the term cross itself being detached
       from the original specifically Christian meaning in modern English (as in
        many other western languages).</p>
    <p id="types">There are four basic types of iconographic representations of the cross:
      <ul>
        <li> the crux quadrata, or <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Greek-cross">Greek cross</a>,
           with four equal arms;</li>
        <li> the crux immissa, or <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Latin-cross">Latin cross</a>,
           whose base stem is longer than the other three arms;</li>
        <li> the crux commissa, in the form of the Greek letter tau,
          sometimes called <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Saint-Anthonys-cross">
            St. Anthony’s cross;</a></li>
        <li>the crux decussata, named from the Roman decussis, or symbol
          of the numeral 10, also known as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Saint-Andrews-cross-cross">
            St. Andrew’s cross</a> for the supposed manner of the martyrdom of St. Andrew the Apostle.</li>
      </ul>
